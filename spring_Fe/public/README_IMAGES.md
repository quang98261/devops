Images added for the cafe app (placeholders)

Files created in `public/images`:
- coffee.svg — coffee cup illustration
- croissant.svg — pastry illustration
- table.svg — table icon
- logo.svg — simple logo placeholder

How to use in the React app:
- Example (JSX):

  <img src="/images/coffee.svg" alt="coffee" width={120} />

- The `public` folder is served at the web root by the frontend build; use absolute paths like `/images/coffee.svg`.

If you want different formats or higher-resolution PNGs, tell me which images you need and I can generate them or provide downloadable files.
